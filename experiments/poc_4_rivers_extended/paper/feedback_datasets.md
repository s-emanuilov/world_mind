Feedback on datasets

**1. The two models complement each other perfectly**

| **Model** | **Purpose** | **Relevance to architectural claim** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Model A:** fine-tuned on factual data | Measures *how much factual ingestion* fine-tuning actually achieves | Establishes the **upper limit of statistical correction**; shows that factual memorization is limited even with supervised injection |
| **Model B:** fine-tuned to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù | Teaches *epistemic calibration* via a behavioral rule, not factual ingestion | Provides the **strongest control condition** against your KG-licensed model‚Äîtests whether abstention can be *learned statistically* instead of enforced architecturally |

This setup is exactly what your critics asked for:

‚ÄúDemonstrate that transformers cannot learn epistemic self-awareness in principle‚Äù
and
‚ÄúCompare fine-tuned calibration against structural gating.‚Äù

Now you can actually test that.

**2. What you‚Äôll be able to show**

If Model B (the abstention-trained LLM) still:

* occasionally answers falsely when it *should* abstain, or
* abstains inconsistently depending on surface form or prompt wording,

while the **KG-licensed** system abstains **deterministically**,
then you‚Äôll have clear evidence that *statistical calibration is fragile*, and *architectural gating is robust*.

That‚Äôs the crux of the ‚Äúsufficiency vs. necessity‚Äù argument.

**3. What to measure next**

You can now evaluate all three systems on the same 18K river Q&A dataset:

| **System** | **Expected behavior** | **Metrics to compute** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **LLM-A (factual fine-tune)** | Slightly higher accuracy, low abstention | Accuracy, hallucination rate |
| **LLM-B (abstention fine-tune)** | Moderate accuracy, higher abstention, but non-deterministic | Accuracy, abstention precision, false abstentions |
| **LLM + KG-licensing** | Near-perfect factual compliance, deterministic abstention | CVRR, GEA, abstention precision |

Plot them side by side.
If the KG-licensed model keeps perfect factual compliance while both LLMs show ‚Äúsoft‚Äù errors, you‚Äôve demonstrated architectural sufficiency.

**4. Interpretation to emphasize**

* **Model A** shows that *factual learning saturates quickly* ‚Äî you can‚Äôt just fine-tune truth into the weights.
* **Model B** shows that *behavioral calibration is learnable but probabilistic* ‚Äî the model ‚Äúknows‚Äù how to abstain in pattern but not in structure.
* **The KG layer** then becomes the structural enforcement of epistemic boundaries.

This triangulation (factual fine-tune / behavioral fine-tune / structural gating) will make your results extremely convincing.

**5. Next small step**

Run the **same evaluation prompts** on all three systems (ideally with your rivers test suite plus a few adversarial ones).
Collect:

* **accuracy** (on factuals)
* **hallucination rate** (false affirmations)
* **abstention precision/recall**
* **coverage-accuracy trade-off**

Then feed those numbers into your HTML report pipeline. That comparison will form the centerpiece of the results section.

**6. Summary**

‚úÖ Simeon‚Äôs two fine-tuning runs are exactly the right pair to benchmark statistical vs. architectural correction.
‚úÖ They provide the empirical controls critics have requested.
‚öôÔ∏è Next: evaluate both models with the same rivers benchmark and KG-licensed gate to quantify relative sufficiency.
üìä Expected outcome: factual fine-tuning improves marginally; abstention fine-tuning improves calibration but remains probabilistic; KG-licensing achieves deterministic epistemic boundaries across domains.

That will decisively demonstrate *why architectural governance outperforms statistical correction* without over-claiming necessity.
