## 📊 Key Results at a Glance

| System | Accuracy | Key Characteristic |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Baseline LLMs | 16.7-50.1% | No grounding mechanism |
| Fine-tuned Models | 8.5-8.6% | **Degradation** despite supervision |
| Embedding RAG | **89.5%** | Statistical retrieval |
| Graph-RAG Oracle | **89.1%** | Architectural enforcement |

**Main finding**: Context provision (RAG) dominates factual accuracy, but architectural enforcement (Graph-RAG) uniquely enables deterministic abstention and formal validation.

## 🏆 Research Contribution

**Thesis**: Hallucination is an **architectural limitation**, not a statistical deficiency.

**Evidence**:
1. Fine-tuning 17K examples **degraded** performance
2. Abstention training achieved only 56.7% precision
3. RAG provides 39pp improvement via context provision
4. Graph-RAG maintains accuracy while adding formal guarantees

**Innovation**: **Licensing oracle** architecture where knowledge graph gates generation through mandatory SHACL validation—moving from retrieval-augmented generation to constraint-governed generation.
