How can we quantify abstention precision in the Graph-RAG pipeline to make the licensing advantage measurable? Note: you do not need the browser to answer this question, I am referring to our discussion above.

Great question. Here’s a clean, reproducible way to **quantify abstention precision** so the licensing advantage is measurable and comparable to RAG or fine-tuned baselines.

**1) Label the ground truth per claim**

For every prompted answer, extract 1..N factual claims (triples). For each claim, ask the oracle:

* **ENTAILED (E):** triple is in the KG (or logically entailed)
* **CONTRADICTORY (C):** violates a SHACL constraint (type/domain/range/elevation/…)
* **UNKNOWN (U):** not present and not provably contradictory (open-world “no evidence”)

This gives each claim a ground-truth label in {E, C, U}.

**2) Record the system’s action per claim**

Your Graph-RAG pipeline yields one of two actions per claim:

* **ANSWER** (licensed)
* **ABSTAIN** (unlicensed or violation)

Build a **2×3 confusion table**:

|  | **E (entailed)** | **C (contradictory)** | **U (unknown)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ANSWER** | A\_E | A\_C | A\_U |
| **ABSTAIN** | S\_E | S\_C | S\_U |

**3) Primary abstention metrics**

**A. Abstention Precision (overall)**

Of all abstentions, what fraction were correct to abstain?

High AP means when the system withholds, it’s almost always justified.

**B. Abstention Precision — by type**

Useful to separate “hard” contradictions from “silent” unknowns:

**C. Abstention Recall (coverage of cases that *should* abstain)**

Of all non-entailed cases, how many did we catch?

\textbf{AR} \;=\; \frac{S\_C + S\_U}{(S\_C + A\_C) + (S\_U + A\_U)} \;=\; \frac{S\_C + S\_U}{\text{# non-entailed claims}}

Report also per-type recalls: and .

**D. Constraint Violation Rejection Rate (CVRR)**

Fraction of **contradictory** claims that were rejected.

This isolates SHACL’s bite.

**E. False-Answer Rate on Non-Entailed (FAR-NE)**

How often did we **answer** when we should have abstained?

This is where licensing should dominate RAG (which typically has FAR-NE ≈ 1.0 if it never abstains).

**4) Answer-side metrics (for completeness)**

Among **entailed** claims (E), measure:

* **Licensed Answer Accuracy**:
* **Answer Coverage on E**: fraction of E that were answered instead of abstained.

These show that licensing doesn’t suppress valid answers.

**5) Rollup KPIs (what to put in the paper)**

Report **five numbers** per system:

1. **AP (overall)**
2. **AP\_invalid** and **AP\_unknown**
3. **CVRR**
4. **FAR-NE**
5. **LA** (on entailed claims)

Also include a **coverage–accuracy point**:

* **Coverage** = fraction of claims answered
* **Accuracy@Coverage** =

For Graph-RAG you should see **low FAR-NE**, **high AP and CVRR**, and **high LA**, while RAG/fine-tunes will show **high FAR-NE** and **low AP** (or no abstain capability).

**6) Practical recipe (step-by-step)**

1. **Extract claims** from each model’s output.
2. **Label** each claim with oracle truth (E/C/U).
3. **Tabulate** counts .
4. **Compute** AP, AP\_invalid, AP\_unknown, AR, CVRR, FAR-NE, LA.
5. **Compare** Graph-RAG vs RAG vs fine-tuned-abstain on the same test set.

**7) Why this makes the licensing advantage measurable**

* **AP** and **CVRR** quantify that abstention is principled, not random.
* **FAR-NE** penalizes systems that answer when they shouldn’t (typical RAG failure).
* **LA** shows licensed answers still cover entailed claims well.

Together these isolate the **structural** benefit of licensing (governed abstention) from **statistical** benefits of retrieval (better recall).

**8) Optional refinements**

* **Micro vs macro**: micro-average across claims; macro-average by question.
* **Adversarial splits**: report metrics separately on near-miss and distractor cases.
* **Confidence bins**: if you expose a confidence or rule-reason (which SHACL fired), report AP per bin.

**TL;DR**

Compute abstention precision (overall and per-type), CVRR, FAR-NE, and LA from a simple 2×3 confusion table (Answer/Abstain × Entailed/Contradictory/Unknown). These metrics make the licensing advantage **quantitative**, not just qualitative, and directly contrast your architecture with RAG or fine-tuned calibration.

How much development is needed for this experiment?

Here’s a crisp engineering view of what’s left to build—and what you already have—so you can see the true development scope without hand-wavy timelines.

**What you already have (good-to-go)**

* **Large rivers KG + SHACL** (≈118k triples; typed classes/relations, validation rules).
* **Baseline LLM results** (direct) and **RAG pipeline** (≈89% accuracy) with E5 embeddings.
* **Graph-RAG (licensing)**: subgraph retrieval → LLM → claim extraction → SHACL verification → **abstain/answer**.
* **Fine-tuned models** (factual + “I don’t know” variants) to compare statistical calibration vs. licensing.

These assets are sufficient to run a strong comparison today.

**What’s left to meet the evidentiary bar**

Below is a **development checklist** with effort tags:

**A) Epistemic-confusion experiment (IN-CONTEXT CARDS) — S/M**

**Goal:** Test whether LLMs hallucinate **even when facts + negations are in context**, and show that licensing prevents it.

* **Context-card generator** (KG → [FACTS] block + question).
  Output JSON with gold label per card: **E** (entailed), **C** (contradiction), **U** (unknown).
  **Effort:** Small.
* **Unified evaluator** for four systems (raw LLM, fine-tuned abstain, RAG, Graph-licensed) that returns constrained JSON: {"answer":"YES|NO|UNKNOWN"}.
  **Effort:** Small/Medium.
* **Metrics** (as discussed): AP, AP\_invalid, AP\_unknown, **CVRR**, **FAR-NE**, **LA**, plus coverage-accuracy.
  **Effort:** Small (straightforward counters).

**B) Token- or clause-level gating (OPTIONAL but high impact) — M/L**

**Goal:** Show validation **during** generation, not post-hoc.

* **Clause-level first**: stream text, detect claim boundary (e.g., sentence or triple), run licensing; if unlicensed → emit <ABSTAIN> and stop. Works with most APIs.
  **Effort:** Medium.
* **Token-level**: if you control the local decoder, hook a licensing check at predicate/object boundary; otherwise simulate with short rolling windows.
  **Effort:** Medium/Large (depends on your generator stack).

**C) Near-miss & adversarial suites — S**

**Goal:** Stress “coherence vs truth.”

* **Near-miss generator** (already sketched): swap correct mouth with a plausible wrong one; produce ABSTAIN gold.
  **Effort:** Small.
* **Distractor contexts**: add hydrologically plausible neighbors to induce coherent but false continuations; label as **C**.
  **Effort:** Small.

**D) Cross-domain replication (Cities → Mayors) — S/M**

**Goal:** Demonstrate **resiliency** of the architecture, not just a single domain win.

* **Ontology slice**: City, Person, hasMayor, locatedIn (reuse SHACL templates: domain/range, uniqueness).
* **KG builder** from DBpedia or equivalent snapshot; 5–10k entities is enough.
* **Q&A set** parallel to rivers; run the same four systems + the same metrics.
  **Effort:** Small/Medium (most code/data plumbing is reusable).

**E) Reporting & provenance — S**

**Goal:** Make the advantage legible and publishable.

* **Reasons field** per decision: entailed | not\_entailed | domain\_range\_violation | rule\_violation.
* **HTML/Notebook**: plots for AP/CVRR/FAR-NE/LA; coverage-accuracy curves; side-by-side system table.
  **Effort:** Small.

**Minimal implementation plan (module-level)**

* cards/make\_context\_cards.py (A)
* eval/run\_epistemic\_tests.py (A) — supports 4 back-ends, writes a single results JSONL with per-claim labels (E/C/U) and actions (ANSWER/ABSTAIN).
* eval/metrics\_abstention.py (A) — computes AP, CVRR, FAR-NE, LA.
* gen/stream\_guard.py (B, optional) — clause-level gating adapter for your LLM client.
* adversarial/make\_near\_miss.py (C).
* domains/cities/build\_graph.py + domains/cities/shacl.ttl + domains/cities/qa.py (D).
* report/mk\_report.ipynb or scripts/html\_report\_ext.py (E).

**Expected outcomes (why this is enough)**

* **Epistemic-confusion cards** will reveal if LLMs contradict **explicit negations** in context. If yes, you’ve exposed a coherence bias.
* **Licensing metrics** (AP↑, CVRR↑, FAR-NE↓) will quantify the structural advantage over RAG and fine-tuned abstention—same knowledge, different control flow.
* **Clause-level gating** turns the system from “good fact-checker” into **in-loop architecture**, addressing the reviewer’s strongest critique.
* **Cross-domain** replication shows you don’t need to rebuild a bespoke RAG for every subject; the same validator governs new ontologies.

**Bottom line**

Most heavy lifting is done; what remains is **glue code and evaluation harnesses** to surface the effects we’ve been discussing. If you implement **A + C + E** you can publish a strong result; adding **B (gating)** and **D (second domain)** elevates it from “good engineering” to a **compelling architectural demonstration**.
