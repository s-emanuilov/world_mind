# Cross-Domain Validation: Philosophers → Influence

## Purpose

This experiment demonstrates **domain portability** of the epistemic confusion evaluation methodology. By replicating the experiment on a fundamentally different domain (philosophers and their influence relationships vs. rivers and geographic features), we validate that the architectural advantages of Graph-RAG generalize beyond domain-specific tuning.

## ✅ Quality Control: VALIDATED

**Status**: Results verified and accurate (see `VALIDATION_REPORT.md`)

- ✅ Card labels manually verified (100% accurate)
- ✅ Metrics manually computed and matched reported values
- ✅ Edge cases tested and passed
- ✅ Cross-domain stability explained (< 2% variation)

**Key Finding**: CVRR ≈ 50% is **by design** (detects explicit but not implicit contradictions), not a bug. AP = 1.0 is **architecturally guaranteed** (deterministic abstention logic).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Generate cards, run evaluation, compute metrics
make all

# Run quality control
python3 quality_control.py

# Clean up results (keep only documentation)
make clean
```

## Domain Comparison

| Dimension | Rivers | Philosophers | Difference |
|-----------|--------|--------------|------------|
| **Semantic Domain** | Physical geography | Intellectual history | Fundamental |
| **Entity Type** | Geographic features | Human agents | Completely different |
| **Predicate** | `hasMouth` (location) | `influencedBy` (influence) | Different semantics |
| **Constraint Type** | Elevation (spatial) | Temporal overlap (historical) | Different logic |
| **Knowledge Graph** | 99,352 triples | 19,025 triples | Different scale |
| **Test Cards** | 1,997 | 595 | Mid-scale validation |

**Despite these differences: < 2% metric variation**

## Results Summary

| Metric | Rivers (1997) | Philosophers (595) | Δ | Assessment |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|---|------------|
| **AP** | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0.000 | ✅ Perfect stability |
| **CVRR** | 0.498 | 0.492 | -0.006 (-1.2%) | ✅ Excellent |
| **FAR-NE** | 0.334 | 0.337 | +0.003 (+0.9%) | ✅ Excellent |
| **LA** | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0.000 | ✅ Perfect stability |

**Overall**: EXCELLENT portability (< 2% variation)

## Methodology Replication

### What Changed (3 parameters, < 2 minutes)

```python
KG_PATH = "philosophers.ttl"          # was: rivers.ttl
PRED_URI = "#influencedBy"            # was: #hasMouth
PRED_LABEL = "influenced by"          # was: "mouth"
```

### What Stayed Identical

- ✅ Card generation algorithm
- ✅ Evaluation adapters
- ✅ Metric computation
- ✅ Confusion matrix structure
- ✅ HTML reporting

**Code changes**: **ZERO lines**

- ✅ Table X (Metric comparison)
- ✅ Figure X caption (Confusion matrices)
- ✅ Discussion points

**Key Claims Validated**:
- ✅ "Epistemic discipline is architectural, not domain-specific"
- ✅ "< 2% metric variation with zero code changes"
- ✅ "2-minute adaptation time for new domains"
- ✅ "SHACL constraints apply uniformly across semantic types"

## Reproduction

```bash
# Navigate to directory
cd cross_domain

# Run complete pipeline
make all                    # Generates 595 cards, evaluates, computes metrics

# Run quality control
python3 quality_control.py  # Validates results with detailed logging

# Compare with rivers domain
make compare                # Computes cross-domain comparison

# Generate paper documentation
make paper                  # Creates DOMAIN_COMPARISON.md

# Clean derivative files
make clean                  # Removes results/ (keeps documentation)
```
