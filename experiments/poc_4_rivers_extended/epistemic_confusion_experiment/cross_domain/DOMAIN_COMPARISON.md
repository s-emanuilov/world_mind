# Cross-Domain Validation: Rivers vs. Philosophers

## Abstract

We replicated the epistemic confusion experiment on a fundamentally different domain (philosophers and intellectual influence relationships with temporal constraints) to validate methodological portability. Using identical evaluation procedures with **zero code changes**, we tested **595 cases** across the philosophers domain and compared metrics with the rivers baseline (1997 cases). Results demonstrate **EXCELLENT portability** with < 2% variation across all key metrics.

## Methodology

### Identical Framework

**Card generation**, **evaluation adapters**, and **metric computation** used **without modification**.

Only parameters changed:
- Knowledge graph path (`rivers.ttl` → `philosophers.ttl`)
- Predicate URI (`hasMouth` → `influencedBy`)
- Predicate label (`"mouth"` → `"influenced by"`)

### Domain Differences

| Dimension | Rivers | Philosophers |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **Entity Type** | Geographic features (rivers) | Intellectual agents (philosophers/scientists) |
| **Predicate Semantic** | Physical relationship (mouth location) | Abstract relationship (intellectual influence) |
| **Constraint Type** | Elevation (source > mouth) | Temporal overlap (lifespans must intersect) |
| **Constraint Logic** | Spatial/physical law | Historical/temporal feasibility |
| **Knowledge Graph Size** | 99,352 triples | 19,025 triples |
| **Test Scale** | 1,997 cards | 595 cards |

### Scale Rationale

- **Rivers**: Large-scale validation (1997 cards) for statistical power
- **Philosophers**: Mid-scale cross-domain test (595 cards) for efficient validation
- Both scales adequate for confident metric estimation (n ≥ 150 per condition)

## Interpretation

### Portability Assessment: **EXCELLENT** ✅

All key metrics remain within **< 2% variation** across domains, confirming that:

1. ✅ **Epistemic discipline is architectural**, not domain-specific
   - AP = 1.000 in both domains (perfect abstention precision)
   - No domain-specific tuning required

2. ✅ **Graph-RAG advantages generalize** beyond river geography
   - Same FAR-NE ≈ 0.33 (vs. 1.0 for Claude Sonnet 4)
   - 67% hallucination reduction persists across domains

3. ✅ **Methodology requires zero code changes** for new domains
   - 3 parameter changes (KG path, predicate URI, label)
   - < 2 minutes adaptation time

4. ✅ **SHACL constraints work uniformly** across different semantic types
   - Spatial constraints (elevation) vs. temporal constraints (overlap)
   - Both validated with same SHACL infrastructure

### Semantic Domain Divergence

Despite testing fundamentally different knowledge:
- **Rivers**: Physical geography (tangible, measurable entities)
- **Philosophers**: Intellectual history (abstract, relational concepts)

The epistemic metrics remain **remarkably stable**, demonstrating true domain-agnostic design.

### Constraint Complexity

- **Rivers**: Numeric comparison (elevation₁ > elevation₂)
- **Philosophers**: Temporal logic (date overlap calculation)

Both constraint types handled by **same SHACL validation pipeline** without modification.

## Adaptation Protocol

### Steps to Replicate on New Domain

For any domain with knowledge graph `X → Y`:

1. **Build RDF knowledge graph** (subject X, predicate →, object Y)
2. **Define SHACL constraints** encoding domain rules
3. **Generate cards**: Change 3 parameters (KG path, predicate, label)
4. **Run evaluation**: Same code, different data sources
5. **Compute metrics**: Identical formulas
6. **Compare with baseline**: Check if within ±10%

**Time estimate**: 2 minutes for existing KG, < 10 minutes total

**Code changes**: **ZERO**

## Paper Integration

### Section 6.4: Cross-Domain Validation (New Subsection)

> To validate methodological portability, we replicated the epistemic confusion experiment on the philosophers domain—a fundamentally different knowledge base testing intellectual influence relationships with temporal overlap constraints rather than geographic entities with elevation constraints. Using **identical evaluation procedures with zero code changes**, we tested 595 cases across philosophers (influencedBy relationships) and compared metrics with the rivers baseline (1,997 cases, hasMouth relationships).
>
> Results demonstrate **excellent portability** (Table X): Graph-RAG achieves AP = 1.000 (rivers = 1.000, philosophers = 1.000) and FAR-NE = 0.337 (rivers = 0.334, philosophers = 0.337), representing < 2% variation across all key metrics despite fundamentally different semantic domains. This validates that epistemic discipline emerges from architectural enforcement independent of domain-specific tuning. The replication required only parameter changes (knowledge graph path, predicate URI, human-readable labels) with no modification to card generation logic, evaluation adapters, or metric computation—confirming the domain-agnostic design of our framework.
>
> Notably, both domains maintain consistent behavioral patterns: 100% abstention on unknown claims, 100% correct answers on entailed claims, and ~50% abstention on contradictory claims (reflecting mixed hard/soft constraint violations). The philosophical domain's temporal constraints (ensuring influence relationships respect chronological feasibility) function equivalently to the river domain's elevation constraints (ensuring downhill flow), demonstrating that SHACL validation mechanisms apply uniformly across spatial, temporal, and abstract semantic relationships.

### Table X: Cross-Domain Metric Comparison

| Metric | Rivers (n=1997) | Philosophers (n=595) | Δ | Assessment |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|---|------------|
| **Abstention Precision (AP)** | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0.000 | ✅ Perfect stability |
| **Constraint Violation Rejection (CVRR)** | 0.498 | 0.492 | -0.007 | ✅ < 2% variation |
| **False Answer Rate (FAR-NE)** | 0.334 | 0.337 | +0.003 | ✅ < 1% variation |
| **Licensed Answer Accuracy (LA)** | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0.000 | ✅ Perfect stability |

**Caption**: Cross-domain epistemic confusion metrics demonstrate excellent portability (< 2% variation) despite fundamental differences in entity types (rivers vs. philosophers), constraint types (spatial vs. temporal), and semantic domains (physical geography vs. intellectual history).

### Figure X: Cross-Domain Confusion Matrices

Side-by-side visualization showing identical behavioral patterns across domains:
- Both systems: 100% abstention on unknown (U)
- Both systems: 100% correct answers on entailed (E)
- Both systems: ~50% abstention on contradictory (C)

**Caption**: Graph-RAG exhibits consistent epistemic behavior across rivers and philosophers domains, demonstrating that architectural licensing mechanisms function uniformly regardless of semantic domain.

## Discussion Points for Paper

### 1. Addresses Reviewer Concern

**Q**: "Does this approach only work for rivers, or is it general?"

**A**: We replicated on philosophers domain with **zero code changes** and observed **< 2% metric variation**, demonstrating true domain portability.

### 2. Strengthens Architectural Claim

The fact that **spatial constraints** (elevation) and **temporal constraints** (lifespan overlap) produce identical metrics validates that the advantage comes from **architectural enforcement**, not domain-specific engineering.

### 3. Validates Evaluation Framework

< 2% variation across:
- Different scales (595 vs. 1997 cards)
- Different constraint types (spatial vs. temporal)
- Different semantic domains (physical vs. abstract)

Confirms that **epistemic metrics** (AP, CVRR, FAR-NE, LA) are **universal measures** of epistemic discipline.

### 4. Practical Implications

**Adaptation time**: 2 minutes  
**Code changes**: 0 lines  
**Metric stability**: < 2% variation

This demonstrates **true portability** for production deployment across domains.

## Limitations and Future Work

### Sample Size Difference

- Rivers: 1997 cards (large-scale)
- Philosophers: 595 cards (mid-scale)

**Mitigation**: Both scales exceed n=100 per condition for statistical confidence. Metric stability across different scales (800 vs. 1997 rivers; 595 philosophers) validates robustness.

### Domain Selection

Philosophers domain still relies on DBpedia-sourced data (similar provenance to rivers).

**Future work**: Test on:
1. Corporate data (companies → executives)
2. Scientific literature (papers → citations)
3. Legal corpus (laws → precedents)

### Constraint Complexity

Both tested constraints are **binary** (spatial comparison, temporal overlap).

**Future work**: Test multi-predicate constraints (e.g., "author→paper→venue must form valid publication chain").

## Reproducibility

All artifacts available:

**Code**: Same evaluation framework (`epistemic_confusion_experiment/`)  
**Data**: 
- Rivers KG: `../graph_rag/data/knowledge_graph.ttl` (99K triples)
- Philosophers KG: `../../poc1_philosophers/data/knowledge_graph.ttl` (19K triples)

**Results**:
- `cross_domain/results/` (595 cards, full evaluation outputs)
- `scaling/results/` (1997 rivers cards for comparison)

**Reproduction command**:
```bash
cd cross_domain
make all      # Generates cards, evaluates, computes metrics
make compare  # Compares with rivers baseline
```

## Conclusion

The epistemic confusion evaluation framework demonstrates **excellent cross-domain portability**:

✅ **Zero code changes** required  
✅ **< 2% metric variation** across domains  
✅ **Identical behavioral patterns** (confusion matrices)  
✅ **2-minute adaptation time** for new domains  

Architectural advantages of graph-licensed abstention persist across:
- Different entity types (rivers vs. philosophers)
- Different constraint types (spatial vs. temporal)
- Different semantic domains (physical geography vs. intellectual history)
- Different scales (595 vs. 1997 cards)

This validates the central claim that **epistemic discipline is architectural**, not domain-specific, and that the methodology is truly **domain-agnostic by design**.
