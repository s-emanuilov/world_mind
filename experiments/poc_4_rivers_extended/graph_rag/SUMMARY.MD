# Graph-RAG Summary: Structured Retrieval with Verification Oracle

The `graph_rag/` directory implements a complete Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that directly validates the World Mind architectural principles outlined in INFO.MD. Unlike standard RAG systems that retrieve text chunks, this approach retrieves structured subgraphs from a formal knowledge graph, extracts factual claims from LLM responses, and enforces truth constraints via SHACL validation—precisely demonstrating the "Truth-Constrained Generation via Graph-Licensed Abstention" research contribution.

**Ontological Foundation:** The system builds a formal knowledge graph (`knowledge_graph.ttl`, 118,047 triples) using an extended domain ontology (`worldmind_core.ttl`) that defines River, GeographicFeature, State, County, RiverSystem classes with 20+ properties including hydrological metrics, spatial relationships, and administrative hierarchies. Semantic integrity is enforced through SHACL constraints (`worldmind_constraints.shacl.ttl`) that validate elevation relationships, positive value requirements for measurements, tributary type consistency, and geographic coherency—directly implementing the theoretical framework's call for "existential grounding" through formal ontological rules.

**Graph Retrieval System:** `graph_retrieval.py` implements multi-hop subgraph retrieval (default 2 hops) that traverses semantic relationships rather than relying on embedding similarity. When a question mentions a specific river, the system extracts the relevant river entity and expands context through tributary relationships, geographic features, administrative boundaries, and hydrological attributes. This structured retrieval provides more accurate contextual understanding than unstructured text chunks, as the graph topology encodes relational knowledge that embeddings cannot capture.

**Evaluation Infrastructure:** `evaluate_graph_rag.py` orchestrates the complete Graph-RAG pipeline: graph retrieval, LLM generation with structured context, claim extraction via GLiNER NER, SHACL-based verification against ontological constraints, and principled abstention when claims fail validation. The system achieved 89.1% accuracy (14,808 correct / 16,626 questions) on the river Q&A dataset—significantly outperforming baseline RAG implementations and establishing that structural retrieval coupled with licensing enforcement substantially reduces hallucination compared to parameter-only approaches like fine-tuning (8.6%) or prompt-only baselines (50.1%).

**Architectural Significance:** This implementation directly embodies the INFO.MD thesis by transitioning the knowledge graph from a passive retrieval source to an active licensing oracle that programmatically enforces truth conditions through SHACL constraint checking before allowing claim generation. The evaluation results provide empirical evidence that architectural enforcement of grounding (via graph-based retrieval and constraint validation) produces systematically higher reliability than probabilistic prompt engineering or parameter optimization alone.
